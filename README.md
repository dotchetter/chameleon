### Sync Windows 10 with sun hours at your location 

Chameleon is a daemon written for Windows 10 which automatically switches between 'Dark' and 'Light' mode depending on sunrise and sunset.
It runs in the background and automatically refreshes it's sun hour dataset once per day. 

### Toggle manually
Either you let Chameleon do the switching, or you can quick toggle between dark and light mode in Windows 10 with the buttons by right-clicking
on the Chameleon icon in your taskbar. 

### Installation
* Download the latest release here: https://github.com/dotchetter/chameleon/releases/download/1.0.0/chameleon.zip
* Double klick **Chameleon.exe**
* **Note:** Chameleon.exe **must** reside in it's original folder to work - either that, or move the associated .ps1 files along.
